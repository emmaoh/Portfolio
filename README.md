# Portfolio

Hi, welcome to my Github page! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emma, and I'm currently a 5th year student at University of British Columbia, majoring in Statistics and minoring in Data Science. I'm excited to share my portfolio on different projects I have completed throughout my academic and professional journey to showcase my interests in statistics, data analysis and data science.
